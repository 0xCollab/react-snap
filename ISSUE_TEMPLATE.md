### If you are reporting a bug

Modern JavaScript development is the complicated process. There are a lot of different dependencies, building processes - different moving parts. The more you have those - the less obvious cause of the problem. You will save us time both if you provide reproducible example upfront, without me asking you one.

Thank you for patience, stay on the line.

### If you are submitting a PR

As of now, I will not accept PRs without tests. It is hard tot test it manually. And yes tests are not implemented yet - there is a ticket for it.
